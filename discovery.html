        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Life is unpredectable, well too many things are for my liking but where this really matters is our environment. We've ignored climate change for years and changes across the planet are no longer something we can ignore as the doom and gloom is already here. Every year unprecident weather events wreak havoc accross land and sea and not only has it gotten more dangerous, it has become consistent. Hotter and longer summers get and colder and shorter the winters have become. We are at a precipice of no return unles we act this decade.<br>
        <br>I want to build APIs for the future which can predict cause and effect for disastors and pandemics. I want to build models that accurately represent data we cannot yet understand, be it deseases without treatment or habitable spaces may become detrimental to sustaining life, I want to solve the important problems we seem to not want to address despite the consequences for our species and those we share the planet with. APIs are the future and all technlogy will be reliant on the creativity of software engineeres. Take a look at the movie below and understand what we could do if we built tools to not only better ourselves, but life for every creature on the planet.</p>

        <p>I believe Computer Science is a purposeful and necessary vocation epitomizing the human disposition and will to survive by blending creativity with practical application. At its core it is the human imagination realised providing solutions to future problems in the my present.</p>

        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <img src="images/5.jpg">
        <p>Over the year I have attended several coding courses learning remotelya and using online tools such as YouTube, Coursera, EDX and GitHub. My learning has included auditing courses from these sources to gain fundamental logic and basis for programming and solving problems.I have a love for creativity and content consumption having spent most of my life around computers. The realization humans can create absurd, altruistic systems and technologies used day to day in supererogatory interests of technological advancemennt is euphoric.<br>
        <br><p>Whether it is the Data Scientists who gather information on chemicals and their particulate structures by working with scientists in preperation for a pandemic, or the Software Engineers who transcode that data into functional programs which unambiguously function to determine specific threats and mitigate risks, the sophistication and hard work behind such technologies ignite by passion for technology and computing.</p>

        <p>The Develop: Code course was well structured and consise. It is perfect for learning fundamentals and logic in programming langauges. As of publishing this website I have been familiarised with the following programming languages; Python, HTML and CSS. Going forward I want to add JavaScript, Swift and C++ to the list</p>
        <img src="images/1.jpeg">
        <p>Though solving problems on my own is enjoyable I tend to over-complicate concepts, this leads me to spend time simplifying implementtion, repeatedly reviweing code -- this is ineffiecient. My implentation and practical techniques need to improve for time contraints, programming can consume plenty of time when you have uncessesary, over-complicated elements and parameters in the code. This is something that was persistent in all my projects but more importantly, I identified it. There's a saying which goes...<br> 
        <br><i>"If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it fully." </i> I am confident that once I am fully orientated with syntax this habbit will not be an issue.</p>

        <p>Java Script is a universal Full Stack package I want to learn to build amazing applications and websites but due to my interests in Data Science; Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, Python will be my speciality. The Develop: Code course with Code Nation was ideal.</p>
