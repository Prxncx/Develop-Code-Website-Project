                <p>Life is unpredectable, well too many things are for my liking but where this really matters is our environment. We've ignored climate change for years and changes across the planet are no longer something we can ignore as the doom and gloom is already here. Every year unprecident weather events wreak havoc accross land and sea and not only has it gotten more dangerous, it has become consistent. Hotter and longer summers get and colder and shorter the winters have become. We are at a precipice of no return unles we act this decade.

                <br>
                I want to build APIs for the future which can predict cause and effect for disastors and pandemics. I want to build models that accurately represent data we cannot yet understand, be it deseases without treatment or habitable spaces may become detrimental to sustaining life, I want to solve the important problems we seem to not want to address despite the consequences for our species and those we share the planet with. APIs are the future and all technlogy will be reliant on the creativity of software engineeres. Take a look at the movie below and understand what we could do if we built tools to not only better ourselves, but life for every creature on the planet.

                I believe Computer Science is a purposeful and necessary vocation epitomizing the human disposition and will to survive by blending creativity with practical application. At its core it is the human imagination realised providing solutions to future problems in the my present.</p>

                <p>Over the year I have attended several coding courses learning remotelya and using online tools such as YouTube, Coursera, EDX and GitHub. My learning has included auditing courses from these sources to gain fundamental logic and basis for programming and solving problems.I have a love for creativity and content consumption having spent most of my life around computers. The realization humans can create absurd, altruistic systems and technologies used day to day in supererogatory interests of technological advancemennt is euphoric.

                <p>The Develop: Code course was well structured and consise. It is perfect for learning fundamentals and logic in programming langauges. As of publishing this website I have been familiarised with the following programming languages; Python, HTML and CSS. Going forward I want to add JavaScript, Swift and C++ to the list.

                Though solving problems on my own is enjoyable I tend to over-complicate concepts, this leads me to spend time simplifying implementtion, repeatedly reviweing code -- this is ineffiecient. My implentation and practical techniques need to improve for time contraints, programming can consume plenty of time when you have uncessesary, over-complicated elements and parameters in the code. This is something that was persistent in all my projects but more importantly, I identified it. There's a saying which goes...
                <br> 
                <br>
                <i>"If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it fully." </i> 
                I am confident that once I am fully orientated with syntax this habbit will not be an issue.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In the first week I covered functions, methods, variables, if/else statements and pretty much everything you need to start building simple progrms. Being practical and writing code as frequently as possible whether you understand the syntax or not is the best way to learn a programming language, grudually it will start to make sense. Python syntax is almsot identical to Ruby so this made things very easy for me. I think this part is comfortable for everybody when they first try a new language, the logic is almost universal when it comes to code.

            <h2>Project 1: Building A Digital ATM</h2>
                This was an independedn project I took on to be more practical with my learning. Using what was covered in week 2 and the notes I took, I wanted to put into action a program that contained all the syntax and logic I had just learned. The result was a simple Cash Machine.</p>

                    Lists were introduced where we covered arrays, sorting and iterating methods. Loops were covered to expand lessons on conditional operation. I decided on taking very detailed notes as the intricay of loop methods was quite complex although simple in logic.

                    Using what we had learned in weeks 1 and 2, I was paired with colleagues and tasked to build a Text-Based Game using Python. New tools were introduced and the power of Slack was discovered. Among these tools was Draw.io a web platform which allows collaboration on project planning via Flow Charts and Trello, used for project board planning. The objective was simple, work together and familiarise working as a team in line with industry

                    Above is a presentation telling you more about the game. We based the concept of our game on the assasination of US President J.F. Kennedy. The story was built around historical record and accounts. You play as the President, then as his would be killer Lee Harvey Oswald tryong to make the best decision you can to expose the conspiracy aginst you masterminded by the powers that be.</p>

                    Probably the most exhausasting of the week, the last leg of the course. HTML and CSS was introduced and we stepped into Web Development. Due to the linear syntax of HTML is was very easy to graps and familiarise however, like most people CSS was... annoying. Its syntax has an annoying curce with too many layers, unlike Python is is very customizable and can be off-putting. Once I understoof the genral logic in the syntax using tutorial and tools to build projects became easy. I found the best way to work with CSS is to not complicate things.

                <h2>Project 3: Building A Website</h2>
                    Designing a website is like going to a Coffee Shop and asking for a hot drink, you then get asked if you want a Caffe Verona but you have no idea what that is. Settling on idea at least for me was the hardest thing to do, I procrastinated for days. Eventually I realized I was complicationg things again and settled in the simplest yet most relevant idea. Lets hope you liked it!
